Hello, 

thank you very much for your interest in participating in this study.
First, for participating in this study we need your confirmation that you have normal color vision and that your age is between 18 and 30 years old. 
Also, we need to create a unique anonymized ID. Using this code is important because it allows us to keep track of previously participated studies while keeping your pareticipation anonymized. 

The code is composed of two letters and four digits, the are the following:

1. The first letter of your mother's first name
2. The third letter of your mother's first name
3. The third letter of your first name
4. The last letter of your first name
5. The resulting number of adding your birth day, month and year

For example:

1.The first letter of your mother's first name: María Aleksándrovna (M)
2.The third letter of your mother's first name: María Aleksándrovna (R) 
3.The third letter of your first name: Vladimir Ilyich Lenin		  (A)
4.The last letter of your first name: VladimieIlyich Lenin		  (R)
5.The resulting name of adding your birth day, month and year (year with four digits): 10 + 04 + 1870 = 1884

At the end, there should be a code consisting of four letters and four digits (e.g., MRAR1884)

Please reply to this email with your confirmations and with the code that you created. 

Many thanks, 
Francesco.
